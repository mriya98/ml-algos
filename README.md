# ML Algorithms
Implement various ML algorithms and loss functions from scratch.

A repository with implementations of ML models and loss functions written from scratch, and theory explained in my blog on Medium: [mriya98](https://medium.com/@mriya98).

I have tried to create functions and modularise code so it can be used with different datasets. Code for both gradient descent and a closed form solution (where it exists) is provided to find optimal weights.
